# Research-Paper-on-Bezier-curves-and-their-possible-application
I wanted a way to move a robot to any position on a map in any way, I also needed a way to move catapults around in my "When Pigs Fly" game. I came to the conclusion that Bezier curves are the solution to both and went into depth behind the math constraints needed to make a continuously differentiable path from Bezier curves stacked together
